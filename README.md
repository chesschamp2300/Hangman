# Hangman
A hangman game for iPhones that I created from scratch in XCode using Swift language.

Features:

- Can keep track of score for every time the user guesses the word correctly. 

- Simple background music playing throughout the game.

- Interactive game as the hangman guy updates each time the user presses a wrong letter. When hangman guy is complete, the user loses.
